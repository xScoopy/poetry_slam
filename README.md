# poetry_slam
Welcome to my poetry slam, where we will be featureing Langston Hughes' poem 'Mother to Son' based on a recommendation from someone that reads infinitely more poetry than I do.

With this poetry slam, I use a menu in terminal to allow the user to choose to display the poem in the form of 5 different options: 
1. original poem
2. backwards
3. random order (with no repeats)
4. shortest line to longest line
5. longest line to shortest line

After each choice, the user will be prompted to press enter to continue so they can read the poem before answering the question again. 

I used import system to assist with clearing the terminal for each new choice for easier visibility. 

typing done in any case will be converted to  uppercase in regards to the if statement.
